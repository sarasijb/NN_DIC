Artificial Neural Net based Control Scheme for a novel 48V-1V DC/DC Converter
This paper presents an Artificial Neural-Network (ANN) based controller for a high gain step-down converter. The proposed topology
adheres to a typical PoL application with two active switches and minimal number of passive components. This resonant converter-based
topology portrays a non-linear gain function, leading to a very high step-down factor without pushing the duty ratios to the extremums. An
ANN based Direct Inverse Control (DIC) technique is implemented that models the inverse response of the system to generate PWM signals
for maintaining a constant output voltage while rejecting load/line disturbances. This model performs offline system characterization
through a training set of large number of operating points for accurate identification for plants that are analytically complex to be
characterized.
